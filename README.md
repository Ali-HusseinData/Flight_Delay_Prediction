# ✈️ Flight Delay Prediction

A machine learning project to predict whether a flight will be delayed based on historical flight data and weather conditions.

---

## Overview
Flight delays can cause inconvenience to passengers and financial losses to airlines.  
This project applies **data analysis**, **feature engineering**, and **machine learning** techniques to predict flight delays.

---

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing delay trends, correlations, and patterns
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting time-based features
- **Model Training**: Testing multiple ML algorithms and tuning hyperparameters
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains:
- Flight date and time
- Airline information
- Departure & arrival airports
- Weather conditions
- Delay status (target variable)
